    "description": "CCCF officially started its journey on June 3, 2023 by honoring cancer survivors. Earlier, on February 4, 2023, on World Cancer Day, a few of us survivors and caregivers gathered for an experience sharing and reunion meeting. The overwhelming response from everyone there urged us to do something seriously. In continuation of that urge, we formed the Center for Cancer Care Foundation (CCCF). In previous events, we started working under the name 'Cancer Care Community, Bangladesh'. Later the name was changed to CCCF.",
    "fundraisingTitle": "Our Main Goal",
    "fundraisingDesc": "Our main objective is to reduce the rate of cancer incidence in the country and ensure a healthy life for those affected by receiving timely treatment through experience sharing among cancer patients and survivors, information exchange, counseling, and increasing awareness about cancer screening, which will reduce the treatment burden.",
